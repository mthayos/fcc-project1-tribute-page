                <p><a id="tribute-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Campbell" target="_blank">Joseph John Campbell</a> (March 26, 1904 – October 30, 1987) was an American professor of literature at Sarah Lawrence College who worked in comparative mythology and comparative religion. His work covers many aspects of the human experience. Campbell's most well-known work is his book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Thousand-Faces-Collected-Joseph-Campbell/dp/1577315936" target="_blank">The Hero with a Thousand Faces</a> (1949).</a></p>

                <p>Since the publication of The Hero with a Thousand Faces, Campbell's theories have been applied by a wide variety of modern writers and artists. He gained recognition in Hollywood when George Lucas credited Campbell's work as influencing his Star Wars saga.</p>

                <p>One of Campbell's most identifiable, most quoted and arguably most misunderstood sayings was his admonition to "follow your bliss". He derived this idea from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upanishads" id="tribute-link" target="_blank">Upanishads</a>:</p>

                    <blockquote>"Now, I came to this idea of bliss because in Sanskrit, which is the great spiritual language of the world, there are three terms that represent the brink, the jumping-off place to the ocean of transcendence: Sat-Chit-Ananda. The word "Sat" means being. "Chit" means consciousness. "Ananda" means bliss or rapture. I thought, "I don't know whether my consciousness is proper consciousness or not; I don't know whether what I know of my being is my proper being or not; but I do know where my rapture is. So let me hang on to rapture, and that will bring me both my consciousness and my being." I think it worked."</blockquote>
                    
                <p>Campbell saw <i>"Follow your bliss"</i> not merely as a mantra, but as a helpful guide to each of us as we walk the Hero's Journey throughout our lives:</p>
                    
                    <blockquote>"If you follow your bliss, you put yourself on a kind of track that has been there all the while, waiting for you, and the life that you ought to be living is the one you are living. Wherever you are—if you are following your bliss, you are enjoying that refreshment, that life within you, all the time."</blockquote>
                    
                <p>Campbell began sharing this idea with students during his lectures in the 1970s. By the time that <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Power-Myth-Joseph-Campbell/dp/0385418868" target="_blank">The Power of Myth</a> was aired in 1988, six months following Campbell's death, "Follow your bliss" was a philosophy that resonated deeply with the American culture—both religious and secular.</p>
